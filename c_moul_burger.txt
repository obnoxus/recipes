C-Moul Burger


Ingredients
- 2 pkgs (or 1 super-value pack) of medium ground beef (leaner if you prefer)
- 3 table spoons of Worcestershire sauce
- 3 table spoons of fish sauce
- 4-6 cloves of garlic (i like garlic)

Directions
- Combine beef, sauces, and mince or crush garlic cloves and mix well.
- Add salt & pepper (qty = preference)
- add a splash of Worcestershire sauce and fish sauce on top and let sit for 30 mins (in fridge or out)
- make the patties
- cook the patties

You can use whatever toppings you like best, Iâ€™ve found that caramelized onions, fried mushrooms, avocado (soft) and some type of chipotle mayo is delicious. Also found that a smoke gouda pairs well with it for a cheese.
