Bologna Fries

Description
I had a thought one day when I was making a Fried Bologna Sandwich. When I sliced up the Bologna I had an extra piece so I decided to cut it up into basically a French Fry shape. I fried them up and ate them like I would French Fries. I dipped them in Mustard and used my hands. They were really good. I wonder how much better they would be if they were deep fried.

Ingredients
Thick sliced Bologna
Directions
You can make these several ways really.
My first time was just in a frying pan as I cooked up a few full slices of Bologna. That worked but wasn't the quickest or easiest way.
The next time I put them on a Baking Sheet and put them in the Oven. Once again that worked and it was easier and faster but I still think they could be better.
The best method, IMHO anyway, is to deep fry them just like French Fries. It takes less time, they are cooked better and are more crispy.

In my experience almost any dipping sauce works. I have tried Mustard, Ketchup, Ranch, McChicken Sauce, Mayo - it all works. Try making your own.
